# Hangman-Game
In this project we have built a GUI game application.

## Prerequisites
[Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-377/) with inbuilt Tkinter

## Game Description
Hangman (particularly this version of it) is a game where the player has to guess a word by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. Number of blanks equal to the number of letters in the word are displayed in the beggining. With every right guess the blanks get filled and with every wrong one the image of a hanged man progresses, whichever completes first decides the result of the game.
